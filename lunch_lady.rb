# I was partners with Javier.  I couldn't get the pull function to work on GitHub so we talked through
# slack while coding separately.  I'm having a lot of trouble figuring out how classes work and wasn't
# able to complete the program.  I tried to program from another angle but was getting an unexpected
# keyword_end, expecting end-of-input error that I still can't figure out why.  I'm guessing I'm 
# mixing up instance functions with classes or not invoking them correctly.  Same goes for the 
# original commented out code block.  For some reason the side_dish function works in some spots
# of the code and not others which stops the program from functioning.  I really need to see some
# more examples or some clarification because I can't find the answers I need online.
